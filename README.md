# NXTThrottle
A throttle quadrant made using Lego Mindstorms NXT

Only runs on windows (ofc). Must use bluetooth to connect to NXT due to USB being hard to work with and being pushed for time. It's a feature not a bug!!

To run this, make sure you have msfs installed and working, move the simConnect.dll from the SimConnect SDK folder into the project folder. Also make sure to get the right com 
port in the NXT file. Then run.
